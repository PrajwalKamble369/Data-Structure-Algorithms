# Data-Structure-Algorithms
I am tracking my daily study of data structure and algorithm in this notebook.

- Today I learn about the time complexity and how to find time complexity of various programs
- There are constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, logaritmic time complexity
- constant < logaritmic < linear < quadratic < cubic

- Learn about array data structure
- It is data structure where we store multiple data points. of similar value and can various in python.
- We can create arrays in python using array and numpy module.
- We can perform various operations on array.
- We can accese array using slicing.
- Array is store data index based
