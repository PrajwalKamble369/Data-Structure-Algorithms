# Data-Structure-Algorithms
I am tracking my daily study of data structure and algorithm in this notebook.

- Today I learn about the time complexity and how to find time complexity of various programs
- There are constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, logaritmic time complexity
- constant < logaritmic < linear < quadratic < cubic
